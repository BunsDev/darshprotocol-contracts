Darsh is a decentralized non-custodial peer-to-peer lending protocol allowing users can take part as a lender or as a borrower. The protocol is made up of a collection of fully autonomous smart contracts that runs on the BNB chain. Unlike most lending protocols that require borrowers to deposit an over-collateralized asset, Darsh allows borrowers to secure a loan with an under-collateralized asset and a trust score.
