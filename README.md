# Project detail
## Name
Darsh Protocol

## About
**Darsh's mission is to create a socialized way of lending and borrowing while maintaining DeFi's autonomy and permissionlessness by offering a decentralized peer to peer way for any individual to engage as a lender or borrower.**

**Our main goal is to provide an efficient and sustainable way for lenders to maximize their rewards on supplied asset by enabling them the ability to structure their loan terms while also removing the risk of an unexpected liquidation of a borrower's collateralized loan all being settled on-chain in a fully decentralized manner.**
